" Some things are only learned by watching hands work"

It all started very early-around the age of six-with a pair of scissors  and a grandmother who had clients coming and going. Fabric quickly revealed itself to me , as something fool of possibilities, and I altered those sleeves...
By sixteen, dresses were being made out of whatever was available: flags, curtains, drapery fabrics. If it could be stitched, it deserved a chance.

The craft was learned the old way, beside master tailors in fashion house, where time mattered  and the inside of the garment was treated with the same respect as the outside. From there, sewing became a passport: London, Paris, New York, Lisbon, Bali-catwalks, haute couture, bridal ateliers, made-to-measure salons, theatre productions, cabaret stages. Work happened wherever fabric, hand and discipline met. Designers, fashion houses, universities- all part of a long, stitched-together journey.

After more than forty years in the industry, the excitement hasn't faded. Fabric in the shop still starts a conversation-that quiet moment when imagination takes over before a single stitch is made. What matters most now is keeping the hands alive-passing on the quiet knowledge that never makes it into textbooks. The small habits, the couture tricks, the patience that turns work into something truly finished, Skyler's Sewing Secrets exists for those who care about neatness, time, and the deep satisfaction of garments that are as beautiful on the inside as they are on the outside.
