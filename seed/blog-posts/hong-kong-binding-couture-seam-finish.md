<p>If you've ever had the chance to look inside a truly couture garment—the kind that costs thousands and takes hundreds of hours to create—you'll have noticed something remarkable about the seams. They're not just finished; they're beautiful. Each raw edge is wrapped in its own little jacket of silk, creating an interior that's almost as stunning as the outside. That's Hong Kong binding, and it's one of my absolute favourite finishing techniques.</p>

<p>I first learned this method in a small haute couture house in Paris, where I was lucky enough to spend several years early in my career. The head seamstress, a formidable woman named Madame Bertrand, would inspect every seam we finished. She'd run her fingers along the inside of the garment, and if she felt a single raw edge, back it would come to your workstation. "The inside," she would say, "tells the truth about the maker." I've never forgotten that.</p>

<h2>Why Go to the Trouble?</h2>

<p>I'll be honest with you: Hong Kong binding takes time. If you're in a hurry, an overlocker will finish your seams in seconds. But there's a reason couture houses have used this technique for generations. The binding completely prevents fraying, which matters enormously for garments that will be worn and cleaned for years or even decades. It also creates a supremely comfortable interior—no scratchy raw edges against the skin, just smooth, soft fabric.</p>

<p>And then there's the sheer beauty of it. When you use a contrasting colour or a lovely silk for your binding, the inside of your garment becomes something special, something that makes you smile every time you put it on. I've bound seams in deep burgundy silk on a black wool coat, in pale pink china silk on a wedding dress, in crisp white organza on a navy jacket. Each one felt like a small gift to the person who would wear it.</p>

<h2>Choosing Your Binding Fabric</h2>

<p>The binding fabric needs to be lightweight—you don't want to add bulk to your seams. China silk is the traditional choice in couture houses, and for good reason. It's smooth, thin, and comes in a rainbow of colours. Silk organza works beautifully too, especially for very fine fabrics. For more casual garments, lightweight cotton lawn or batiste will do nicely.</p>

<p>Whatever you choose, cut it on the bias. This is important because bias-cut strips have stretch, which allows them to wrap smoothly around curves and corners without puckering. I typically cut my strips about 2.5cm wide, but you can adjust this depending on your seam allowance width.</p>

<h2>The Process</h2>

<p>Here's how I do it. First, I lay my bias strip against the raw edge of the seam allowance, right sides together. I stitch about 6mm from the edge, keeping my line nice and straight. Then I fold that bias strip over the raw edge, wrapping it around to the back. Finally, I stitch in the ditch from the right side—that means sewing exactly in the groove where the strip meets the seam allowance. The stitching catches the folded edge underneath, securing everything in place. A quick trim of any excess, and you're left with a perfectly bound edge.</p>

<p>The technique takes some practice. The trickiest part is catching that folded edge consistently when you stitch in the ditch. I recommend practising on scraps until you get a feel for it. You'll develop a sense for how tightly to wrap the strip and where exactly to place your stitches.</p>

<h2>A Little Secret</h2>

<p>Here's something I learned years ago that I share with all my students: for very delicate fabrics like lace or fine silk, try using tulle for your Hong Kong binding. It sounds unusual, but tulle is lightweight, doesn't fray, and practically disappears while still protecting those raw edges. I use it constantly for bridal work and evening wear. The ladies at that Paris atelier would use the finest flesh-coloured tulle so the binding would be nearly invisible. It's one of those quiet couture secrets that makes all the difference.</p>

<p>Yes, Hong Kong binding requires patience. Yes, you could finish those seams in a fraction of the time with an overlocker. But every time you slip into a garment and feel nothing but silky smoothness, every time you catch a glimpse of those beautifully bound seams, you'll remember why some techniques deserve to survive. This is sewing as it was meant to be done—with care, with pride, and with an eye toward beauty in places most people will never see.</p>
