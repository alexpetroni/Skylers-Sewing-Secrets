				about potential outcomes are for illustrative purposes only.
			</p>

			<h2>2. No Earnings Guarantees</h2>
			<p>
				This course is not a business opportunity or income programme. We make no claims, promises, 
				or guarantees about your ability to earn money using the skills taught in this course. Any 
				testimonials or success stories shared are individual experiences and are not typical results.
			</p>

			<h2>3. Skill Development Claims</h2>
			<p>
				While we are confident in the quality of our instruction, individual results will vary based on:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Prior sewing experience and skill level</li>

				<li>Quality of equipment and materials used</li>
				<li>Individual learning pace and aptitude</li>
				<li>Consistency in applying taught techniques</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>4. Professional Results Disclaimer</h2>
			<p>
				The professional techniques taught in this course are the same methods used in professional 
				settings. However, achieving professional-level results requires significant practice, 
				patience, and dedication beyond simply watching the lessons.
			</p>

			<h2>5. Testimonials</h2>
			<p>
				Testimonials and reviews on our website represent individual student experiences. These 
				testimonials are genuine but may not represent typical results. Students featured in 
				testimonials have given their consent to share their experiences.

			<h2>6. Equipment and Materials</h2>
			<p>
				Success in sewing also depends on the quality of your sewing machine, tools, and fabrics. 
				While we provide guidance on equipment, we do not guarantee that any specific equipment will 
				produce particular results.
			</p>

			<h2>7. Health and Safety</h2>
			<p>
				Sewing involves the use of sharp tools, needles, and machinery. Users are responsible for 
				their own safety when practising techniques taught in the course. We recommend:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Following manufacturer safety guidelines for your sewing machine</li>
				<li>Using appropriate safety equipment</li>
				<li>Working in a well-lit, organised workspace</li>
				<li>Taking regular breaks to prevent repetitive strain</li>

			<h2>8. Third-Party Products</h2>

				are based on personal experience and are provided for educational purposes. We are not 
				responsible for the quality or performance of third-party products.

			<h2>9. Course Updates</h2>
			<p>
				Course content may be updated, modified, or expanded over time. While we strive to keep 
				content current and accurate, we do not guarantee that all information will remain up-to-date 
				indefinitely. Fashion and sewing techniques evolve, and some methods may change over time.
			</p>
