				<p class="mt-6 text-lg leading-8 text-gray-600">
					I'm a tailor with 37 incredible years of weaving stories through fabric and design. 
					My journey started as a simple seamstress and has taken me from fashion houses across 
					Europe to teaching at London's art university, and even designing costumes for a vibrant 
					cabaret in Bali.
				</p>
				<p class="mt-4 text-lg leading-8 text-gray-600">
					I've learned that tailoring isn't just about stitching—it's about transforming cloth into 
					confidence, creating pieces that tell a story, and making people feel extraordinary. 
					Whether I'm working with delicate haute couture in Paris or bold theatrical designs in 
					Budapest, my passion has always been about turning every garment into a masterpiece of 
					personal expression.
